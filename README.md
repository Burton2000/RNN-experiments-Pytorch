# RNN time series generation experiments
This repo provides an example of training an RNN/GRU model to overfit and generate a sin wave that it's trained on. Once trained we supply an initial sequence of points and the model will then continue to generate the sin wave its. 

Obviously this isn't a particularly difficult task but is meant as just a way to get experience using RNNs in PyTorch.
